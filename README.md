## Things to consider

* I haven't done any game dev in about 10 years, and this is teh first time I've worked with phaserjs.
* Darkmage has worked on his c sdl based game for three years to draw sprites and circles, so he has the experience.
* I haven't done any coding with vectors or geometric shapes since you never have to do that stuff in web development.
* Darkmage really pussied out and did a circle as the level design. This the easiest approach.
* I instead have at least used geometric tempest levels
 * I had wanted to make the entire game geometric however towards the end it was time saving to use sprites for some parts.

* Darkmage has resorted to spreading fake news about myself forfitting the competition. This is clearly fake news. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IuIpSVncpw
