# TEMPESTBIRD

Clone of Tempest https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(video_game) called TempestBird because darkmage is a fake dev fake hacker fag, and this proves it.

Shout outs to

* JRH
* LRH
* EFNET
* E2N2
* IRC
* INTERNET

## Components

* Built with vuejs2
* Game library https://phaser.io/ for all the shit darkmage will probably code himself reinventing the wheel like a fake dev fag

## Helpful Links

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2Sv28sYUZc - Tempest gameplay (46 minutes). Mate I've watched this three fucking times. I know this Tempest shit aight. Yeah I read like half that PDF too bro.

* Uses the Wells-gardner color X-y display vector-generator monitor, meaning we'll have to try replicate the vectors entirely (no fonts for numbers or text)
 * http://www.vectorlist.org/Documents/6100_faq.pdf - More cool information about XY vector displays

## Considerations

* The major game input is the spinning wheel, which is how the player can move so fast on the arcade version. This will have to be replicated with the mouse, too slow for keyboard. Although I bet darkmage will try to bind player movements to keyboard events like a boiled crab with down syndrome.
